# Findings — Report Builder

## Session 2026-08-24 — Slice 1 (auth area), Phase B

- **Integration smoke (browser-origin simulation):** POST login from
  `Origin: http://localhost:3000` → 200, `ACAO` echoes the origin,
  `allow-credentials: true`, both httpOnly cookies issued. Combined
  with A7 this closes the client↔server loop at HTTP level; the
  interactive browser walk remains the owner's step-5 pass.
- **Scaffold drift fixed:** `theme/customizations/datePickers.js`
  imported `pickersDayClasses` (pre-rename name, unused import
  remnant) while using it at four style sites under its v9 name
  `pickerDayClasses` — import corrected to match usages; build went
  green. Lesson: substring greps mislead — grep the exact symbol.
- **Layout ownership:** pages must NOT embed PublicLayout — the
  router owns layout branches (§41.3); initial page drafts embedded
  it and were stripped to avoid a double app-bar.
- **react-compiler lint rule** flags RHF `watch()` as incompatible-
  library; the name-reveal preview uses `useWatch({control})`
  instead (also cleaner: no whole-form subscription).
- **Route-map gate nuance:** `element` appears only for guards,
  layouts, error page and 404 (the §41.3 static participants); every
  PAGE route uses the lazy `Component` form with literal specifiers.
- **Vite build chunk graph confirms code-splitting:** Login/
  Register/Landing/Dashboard are separate lazy chunks.

## Session 2026-08-24 — Slice 1 (auth area), Phase A

- **A7 sync-walk evidence (live, port 4000, Mongo local):** health
  `{"status":"up",uptime}` exact envelope · register 201 with exact
  DTO (derived beza/ayalew, `fullName` virtual, no password/id/__v) ·
  duplicate 409 exact copy via global-handler dup-key mapping ·
  invalid email 422 aggregate details shape · wrong-password 401
  identical copy, cookie-less · login 200 "Welcome back" setting
  httpOnly SameSite=Lax cookies at paths `/api/v1` (access) and
  `/api/v1/auth` (refresh) · refresh 200 "Session refreshed" with
  rotated refresh value (old ≠ new proven from jars) · logout
  idempotent clearing BOTH cookies (Max-Age=0 headers captured) ·
  Google stub 404 exact open-question copy. Server killed after walk;
  port 4000 verified free.
- **Mongoose 9 hook idiom:** async pre hooks must not declare
  `next` — pure async functions only (next-style throws "next is not
  a function").
- **express-validator matchedData** is flat by default; §29.2's
  `{ body, params, query }` buckets need explicit
  `locations` per call in the harness.
- **authenticate mounting deferred:** no auth route is protected in
  this slice (profile/avatar deferred), so `middleware/auth.js`
  exists as the §28-owned artifact; its first route-group mount lands
  with the branches slice.
- **AI-tier limiter deferred** (no AI endpoint yet); rateLimit.js
  ships global + auth tiers only.
- **New constants consumed this slice** (all §11.3 rows already
  declared): BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS, ACCESS/REFRESH TTLs (+ derived MS,
  MS_PER_MINUTE, MS_PER_DAY), MONGO_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS, DB_RETRY_*,
  LOG_RETENTION_DAYS, MONGO_DUPLICATE_KEY_ERROR_CODE, RATE_LIMIT_*
  six. Spec-mirror additions owed same-commit: API_MOUNT_PATH,
  MS_PER_MINUTE, MS_PER_DAY, SHUTDOWN_FORCE_TIMEOUT_MS rows in §11.3.

## Session 2026-08-24 (P1)

- **Owner directives (this session, binding):**
  1. Build strategy: vertical slices by domain area — small backend
     area → its frontend integration → sync; backend leads when an
     area cannot sync; no mock adapter ever ("no version, just Report
     Builder" — this workspace is the single canonical product).
  2. The spec's feature sections can be wrong: the §52 wizard is
     dropped (V3's re-implementation had already replaced it with a
     `ReportWorkspace` page). What survives from the spec is the
     engineering law: no hardcoded values, named constant homes,
     frozen objects.
  3. KNOWN OR AMENDED ONLY (refined same session): known = logically
     valid or already established (§1 problem statement; earlier-set
     priorities like [auth → branches → reports]; naturally-valid
     sets like HTTP status codes); amended = what each Step-1.1
     identification explicitly decides. Define on require:
     spec-scheduled but unamended items stay out until a real
     consumer requires them, then land in their proper place with a
     proven need and reason — universal across constants, env vars,
     directories, structures, features, dependencies. Recorded in
     `AGENTS.md` this commit.

- **Spec-vs-reality reconciliation (start of session):**
  - This workspace (`main@c7032f2`) tracked only manifests, client
    theme layer, scaffold, and the spec — despite §15/§13.5/§66
    markers claiming implemented files/installs elsewhere.
  - `backend/.env` holds all §10.4 required names plus extra entries
    (`ADDIS_AI_*`, `OAUTH_GOOGLE_*`, `LOG_LEVEL`). Resolution per
    §26.2: ENV_SPEC exposes exactly §10.4 keys; the extras are
    SDK/internal-scope and stay unread by our code.
  - `client/.env` exists with VITE_ vars; `.gitignore` covers `.env`,
    logs, dist, uploads, node_modules.
  - Prior workspaces on disk (`1.Report-Builder-V3` et al.) contain a
    proven implementation used strictly as read-only reference for
    conformant patterns; current spec canon wins over any drift.

- **AGENTS.md staleness noted (not silently edited):** its "Current
  state" section still says "Git main at 0 commits" while `main`
  carries `c7032f2`. Left untouched — outside approved scope; flagged
  to the owner at step-5 review.

- **Design decisions:**
  - `env.js` modeled on the proven reference but without the addisai
    singleton (no consumer yet — orphan discipline).
  - `constants.js` ships as skeleton + deepFreeze helper; domain
    groups join per slice (auth/rate-limits first).
  - `httpStatus.js` ships complete (§11.6): pure HTTP vocabulary,
    feature-independent, consumed by every slice.
  - `server.js` is a ~10-line fail-fast prototype, superseded by the
    §26 foundation when the auth slice opens.
